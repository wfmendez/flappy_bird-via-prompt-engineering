flappy_bird-via-prompt-engineering üê¶‚ú®

Welcome to the Flappy Bird - Via Prompt Engineering repository! üëã This project is a modern reimagining of the classic Flappy Bird game, with a twist: it was developed using Prompt Engineering with Artificial Intelligence tools for code generation in Flutter.

This effort not only demonstrates my ability to build functional applications in Flutter but also my skill in leveraging AI as a development tool, optimizing the coding process and exploring new methodologies.

Project Goal üéØ
The primary purpose of this project was twofold:

Create a Functional Flappy Bird Clone: Develop an interactive and fun game in Flutter, including game logic, collision detection, and scoring.
Explore Prompt Engineering: Practice effective communication techniques with AI models to generate code snippets, structures, or even complete game logic, showcasing how AI can accelerate and assist the development process.

Game Features üéÆ
Classic Gameplay: Control the bird to fly through obstacles (pipes) without colliding.
Collision Detection: Logic to detect impacts with pipes or the ground, ending the game.
Scoring System: Keeps track of points earned by passing between pipes.
Basic User Interface: Intuitive controls and simple visual elements for a clear gaming experience.

Technologies and Methodologies Applied üíª
Flutter (Dart): The primary framework used for cross-platform mobile application development.
Prompt Engineering: The core methodology for guiding and obtaining AI-generated code (from models like ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) to speed up the development of game features and components.
Game Development Principles: Application of basic game logic and state management concepts.
Installation and Execution ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

To get your Flappy Bird soaring:

Clone the repository:
Bash

git clone https://github.com/wfmendez/flappy_bird-via-prompt-engineering.git
Navigate to the project directory:
Bash

cd flappy_bird-via-prompt-engineering
Get the Flutter dependencies:
Bash

flutter pub get
Run the application:
Bash

(Make sure you have an emulator or physical device connected and configured.)
Lessons Learned üß†
This project was an invaluable learning experience on several fronts:

Flutter Development: I strengthened my skills in building user interfaces and game logic with Flutter.
AI Collaboration: I learned to formulate effective prompts to get useful code and to efficiently integrate AI-generated code into a real project.
Workflow Optimization: I discovered how AI can act as a "copilot" to streamline repetitive tasks and explore solutions more quickly.
